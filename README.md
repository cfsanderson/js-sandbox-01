# Javascript Basics
## Beau Teaches Javascript

This project is based on [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) _*"Javascript Basics: Beau Teaches Javascript"*_ video playlist on YouTube by [Beau Carnes](http://carnes.cc/).  

I started using a basic [vanilla JS app](https://github.com/cfsanderson/vanilla-js-boilerplate) (which was created with @ambethia's [`app-app` boilerplate](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-fee/app-app)) so that I could follow along with the videos and run the code locally. I realized that these short tutorials might be a good basis for a kid's class and having all the code for them to follow along with would be helpful. I gave it a simple UI so the students can run, alter, and publish their own versions.  

Everything is happening in the console so pop open the dev tools and check it out. There is a separate .js file for each video. As of right now, to see changes you need to hard-code the `src` in the index.html's script tag but I'm planning to fix that asap. Feel free to tweet at me with questions, comments, concerns, or complaints - @cfsanderson.

## TODO
- [ ] change the src of script tag with button click
- [ ] generate link tags for buttons dynamically (not hard-coded)?
- [ ] footer with contact info
- [ ]
